## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this section I implemented many things I have learned from the Frontend Mentor Community including semantic HTML and some CSS tips and tricks. During this project I found a method on how to make an element fade in through the use of the opacity CSS filter which made the hover effects in the project easy to make.

### Continued development

I did have to use a media query in order to reset the min-width property I have added to the main element so it looks like the designs on Desktop and Mobile. I would like to see if I am able to remake this design without it and make it cleaner in the future.
